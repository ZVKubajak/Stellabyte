## Usage
Checkout the deployed site at [https://stellabyte-production.up.railway.app](https://stellabyte-production.up.railway.app). Create an account and upload a file up to 50MB to the cloud. When the upload process is finished, users can view their file's generated artwork.

Each artwork contains a bunch of colorful little stars and one big center star. The center star's color is determined by the uploaded file's MIME type, and the size is determined by the file size. Each little star also represents part of the file size, but the color is random. The nebulas are randomly generated.

Users can also download the files they uploaded at any time, or delete them from the cloud storage.
